# MachineLearningProjects
My machine learning projects for the course "Introduction to Machine Learning" (MSc level - 2019) at ETH Zurich. I worked in the group "Graphkrone" of two people formed by me and @ruslenghi.

These projects allowed me to get practical experience on the topics of: Linear-Regression, Regularizers, Cross-Validation, Neural-Networks, Convolutional-Neural-Networks, PCA, K-means, feature engineering, data preprocessing, data visualization, data imbalance and with the libraries Sklearn, Tensorflow.
